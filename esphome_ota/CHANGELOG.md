# Changelog

## 0.1.0

Initial release.

- Pulls `firmware.ota.bin` from the ESPHome Device Builder add-on over its
  documented WebSocket API (`firmware/compile`, `firmware/follow_job`,
  `firmware/download_token`), auto-detected via the Supervisor.
- Publishes firmware, MD5, and an ESP-Web-Tools manifest to `<config>/www/`,
  served by Home Assistant at `/local/` — no host ports opened.
- Generates two ESPHome packages: `update.yaml` (update entity) and
  `flash_button.yaml` (force-install button).
- Relative manifest paths so LAN and remote-tunnel access both work unchanged;
  `?v=<md5>` cache buster against proxy caching of `/local`.
- Ingress UI to build, publish, and copy the per-device YAML snippet.
